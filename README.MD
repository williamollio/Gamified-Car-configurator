# 🕹️ Gamified Car Configurator 🚗

</br>

## About 📖

</br>

*This project was created in 3 days during the [MHP - A Porsche Company](https://www.mhp.com/en/home) "Mobility Hack 2022" Hackathon and earned us the second place. Your create your avatar, we create a car configuration for you.
We choose to build this configurator because usually people spend more time creating avatar as playing because it's fun.*

## Introduction

</br>

*Did you ever try to configure your dream car and felt like **drowning** in all the options and features?* 😖


*We feel you, we know the **frustration**, but we have a **solution**, using **gamification**.* 👍

</br>

## How does it work ? 🔧

</br>

*The idea was to create a **sophisticated algorithm** which we **simplified** a lot to be able to implement the idea in 3 days.*

</br>

(1) You **create an avatar** which corresponds to you.

(2) We perform a **profiling** and apply a **scoring** system.

(3) You got your **car configuration**, based on your **needs** and **lifestyle** !

</br>

> Let's **start customizing our Avatar**, first we have to fill in some input parameters.

</br>

> Damn ! That's exactly the car I was looking for ! 🚙 Let's take a look in the **showroom**, on the right side you can see all the addiotional options of the car.

## Business Model 📈

</br>

- SAAS (Software as a Service) on which car brands can register and enable users to configure their car through gamification.

- If an appointement is taken, we could charge the company.

</br>

## Roadmap 🚀

</br>

Actually the logic is pretty simple and based on "stereotypes"

-> **But**, by adding more **input parameters** we could find a better matching car.

-> Based on your **feeback** we could improve our configurator's **accuracy**

-> Aside of finding your car in **this world**, we could also help you to find your **virtual car** in the **Metaverse**.
